*3/28/17 - Yuri*

Ideas:  
+Have minimum transaction fee for every task ($5 min.?)  
+Use Google Firebase to handle realtime updates = auto task re-fresh  
  ~back-end database - NEED TO RESEARCH ON HOW TO USE  
+Have proprietary "Cha-ching" noise when task is completed (app notification sound)  

*3/28/17 - Leah*

+Might not implement due to unnecessary difficulty and payment, but 'usage fee' 
	small amount goes to us (the developers) for our service? (like a tax)
