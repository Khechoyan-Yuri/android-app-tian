*3/28/17 - Yuri*

Ideas:  
+Have minimum transaction fee for every task ($5 min.?)  
+Use Google Firebase to handle realtime updates = auto task re-fresh  
  ~back-end database - NEED TO RESEARCH ON HOW TO USE  
+Have proprietary "Cha-ching" noise when task is completed (app notification sound)
+Have a 'Star Rating' system to rate the student that issued the task & the dundie that completed the task

*3/28/17 - Leah*

+Might not implement due to unnecessary difficulty and payment, but 'usage fee' 
	small amount goes to us (the developers) for our service? (like a tax)
+Potential problem: People simply marking tasks 'incomplete' to avoid paying
+Potential problem:
+Tasks with pieces (i.e. 7 papers to deliver to different people, 
	thus seven people could do it or could break it up to split the pay)
+Ability to request pay increase (But not force)-"This is too difficult for $5"
	maybe other suggestions/commentary?
+Ability to save tasks that you might want to repeat
+Communication line between Requester and Accepter
+Icons for tasks? (i.e. to give an idea of what type of task it is)
